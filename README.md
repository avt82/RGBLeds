RGB 12v remote controller (ESP32 WiFi / ESP-Now)

Idea is:

ESP32-Wroom-32D module is powered from AC-DC 3W level converter, latching EMR is used to switch power for 25W power supply, and 4 PWM channels are used to control the RBG Led intensity.

RBG Stripe with common anode is used.

Flasher for ESP32 is here: https://github.com/avt82/TagConnect (Cable TC2030-MCP-NL is required).
